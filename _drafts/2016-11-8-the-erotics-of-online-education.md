## The Buffered Self

Charles Taylor on the idea that modern self is "buffered", cut off from the world.

## Priority of the Visual above the Tactile

> Ever since Ren√© Descartes and John Locke invented an entity called "the mind," thinking has come to be understood as reflection. Just as the mirror reflects the light waves without its own substance becoming affected, the mind mimetically represents the outside world while at the same time remaining separate from it. (Veit Erlamann, *Reason and Resonance: A History of Modern Aurality*, pg. 9)

In this essay I want to argue for three claims that I think are interrelated: the move toward online courses have exacerbated a trend in which education is increasingly disembodied, displaced and de-eroticized. Each one of these topics could be the subject of intense research on their own, but I think it's important to think of them together.  

There's this idea of presence that gets talked about often within the context of instructional design for online courses. Instructors are encouraged to create a robust "presence" within the course. This is typically thought to help students understand that the instructor "cares" about their success and thus serve as an additional motivator for students to reach the learning objectives. While I don't deny that it is a good practice to be actively engaged in the course as it is running and to provide spaces within which students can interact with the instructor and each other, the concept of instructor "presence" doesn't really get at why there has always been something missing for me in online courses.
