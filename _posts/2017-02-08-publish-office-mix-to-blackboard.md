title: How to Post Your Office Mix to Blackboard
---

*Before posting to Blackboard, you need to upload your Mix to the web. View instructions for uploading your Mix here: [https://mix.office.com/watch/9hxag6wimvxr](https://mix.office.com/watch/9hxag6wimvxr)*

1. Go to [https://mix.office.com/](https://mix.office.com/) and sign in with your UH Office 365 account.
2. Click the "My Mixes" link at the top of the page.
3. Find the Mix you want to share and click the "Details" link beneath the title.
4. By default, the permissions for your Mix will be set to "Private". You need to change that so others can view your Mix on the Web. Slide the permissions dialogue to the right to select the level of permissions. We suggest choosing "Unlisted". For more information on permission levels, view this article: [http://www.mixforteachers.com/decide-who-can-watch-your-mix.html](http://www.mixforteachers.com/decide-who-can-watch-your-mix.html)
5. After selecting your permission levels, click "Save".
6. Once your permissions are saved, you can copy the link below the Mix Preview.
7. You can now add this link to your Blackboard course. For a tutorial on adding links, view this article: [https://en-us.help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Course_Content/Create_Content/020_Create_Course_Materials/Link_to_Websites#Create_a_web_link](https://en-us.help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Course_Content/Create_Content/020_Create_Course_Materials/Link_to_Websites#Create_a_web_link).

**Embedding a Mix into Blackboard**

*If you would like for your students to view your Mix within Blackboard, follow these additional steps.*
8. On the "Details" page of your Mix, click the "Embed" link beneath the Permissions dialogue box.
9. Select the "small" size.
10. Click the text box with the embed code and copy the code.
11. In Blackboard, navigate to your course and the area where you want to embed your Mix. With the Edit Mode "On", select "Build Content" and then "Item".
12. Give your Item a Name. In the text field, click the "HTML" button.
13. When the HTML editor pops up, paste the embed code. Click "Update".
14. When the HTML editor closes, click "Submit" to save.
