title: Video Hosting Platforms
---

With the increasing use of instructional videos created by faculty, a practical question we often get asked is what is the best platform to host videos for student access. Unfortunately, the answer depends on what is important to you. If you want a platform, say, that is open to the web, easy to use, and highly adaptive to different devices, then Youtube is your best bet. If, on the other hand, your priority is securing your content by restricting access to it from UH Blackboard, then our homegrown CASA Cloud platform is your best solution. Or, you may want something that is built in to the software you are using, like Snagit or Screencast-O-Matic, in which case you'd want to go with their own hosting platform. The good news is that there are a lot of solutions out there that provide user-friendly and reliable access to your video content that students need to succeed in your course. Below I have compiled a list of video platforms that we see faculty using successfully.

## Youtube

Youtube is a great, free platform for hosting instructional videos, especially if you want to create libraries of on-demand resources for your students.

*Pros*

- Universally recognized
- Unlimited storage
- Easy to use
- Fast uploading times
- Ability to create playlists to group videos for courses/modules
- Works great on any device
- Generates an automatic closed caption track that can be edited for accuracy
- Embraces the open web

*Security*

- Youtube has three security settings for videos and playlist, depending on how you public or private you want your content to be:
  - **Public** videos and playlists can be seen by and shared with anyone.
  - **Private** videos and playlists can only be seen by owner and the users the owner chooses.
  - **Unlisted** videos and playlists can be seen and shared by anyone with the link.

*Cons*
- If you are comfortable with Youtube's security settings, there is very little not to like about the platform.

## Vimeo

Vimeo is very similar to Youtube, with more security settings and advanced customization. It is an excellent platform used by many documentary film makers and independent artists.

*Pros*

* Easy to use
* Fast uploading times
* Ability to create playlists to group videos for courses/modules
* Works great on any devices
* Add closed captioning file
* Create Custom URLs for videos
* Advanced security

*Security*
- Vimeo has a few more security settings than Youtube.
  - **Anyone** - videos are Public
  - **Only me** - videos can only be seen by owner
  - **Only people I follow** - videos can only be seen by owner and Vimeo users the owner follows
  - **Only people I choose** - videos can only be seen by owner and selected Vimeo users
  - **Only people with a password** videos can only be seen by people with a correct password
  - **Only people with a private link** - videos can only be seen by people who have the link (Pro account only)
  - **Hide this video from Vimeo.com** - videos can be embedded on other sites but can't be viewed on Vimeo.com (Pro account only)
- For more on Vimeo's security settings see their [Privacy Settings Overview](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224817847-Privacy-settings-overview
)

*Cons*

- Free Vimeo account only allows 500MB/week of storage and 25GB/year. However, the plus plan is very affordable at $60/year and allows 5GB/week and 250GB/year.
