title: Video Hosting Platforms
---
**Draft**

With the increasing use of instructional videos created by faculty, a practical question we often get asked is what is the best hosting platform for streaming video. "Streaming" means that the video can viewed without the need to download the video file to a local drive.

Unfortunately, the answer depends on what is most important to you. If you want a platform, say, that is open to the web, easy to use, and highly adaptive to different devices, then Youtube is your best bet. If, on the other hand, your priority is securing your content by restricting access to it from UH Blackboard, then our homegrown CASA Cloud platform is your best solution. Or, you may want something that is built in to the software you are using, like Snagit or Screencast-O-Matic, in which case you'd want to go with Screencast.com or Screencast-O-Matic.com. The good news is that there are a lot of solutions out there that provide user-friendly and reliable access to your video content. Below I have compiled a list of video platforms that we see faculty using successfully.

## Youtube

[http://youtube.com](http://youtube.com)

Youtube is a great, free platform for hosting instructional videos, especially if you want to create libraries of on-demand resources for your students.

*Pros*

- Universally recognized
- Unlimited storage
- Easy to use
- Fast uploading times
- Ability to create playlists to group videos for courses/modules
- Works great on any device
- Advanced online video editor
- Generates an automatic closed caption track that can be edited for accuracy
- Embraces the open web

*Security*

- Youtube has three security settings for videos and playlists:
  - **Public** videos and playlists can be seen by and shared with anyone.
  - **Private** videos and playlists can only be seen by owner and the users the owner chooses.
  - **Unlisted** videos and playlists can be seen and shared by anyone with the link.

  | Feature       |	Unlisted	| Private	| Public |
  |---------------|:---------:|:-------:|:------:|
  | Can share URL	| Yes     	|No       |Yes     |

  | Shows up in search and related videos |	No | No | Yes |
  | Posted on your channel |	No | No | Yes |

*Cons*
- If you are comfortable with Youtube's security settings, there is very little not to like about the platform.

## Vimeo

[http://vimeo.com](http://vimeo.com)

Vimeo is very similar to Youtube, with more security settings and advanced customization. It is an excellent platform used by many documentary film makers and independent artists.

*Pros*

* Easy to use
* Fast uploading times
* Ability to create playlists to group videos for courses/modules
* Works great on any device
* Add closed captioning file
* Create Custom URLs for videos
* Advanced security
* Allow videos to be downloaded

*Security*

- Vimeo has a few more security settings than Youtube.
  - **Anyone** - videos are Public
  - **Only me** - videos can only be seen by owner
  - **Only people I follow** - videos can only be seen by owner and Vimeo users the owner follows
  - **Only people I choose** - videos can only be seen by owner and selected Vimeo users
  - **Only people with a password** videos can only be seen by people with a correct password
  - **Only people with a private link** - videos can only be seen by people who have the link (Plus account only)
  - **Hide this video from Vimeo.com** - videos can be embedded on other sites but can't be viewed on Vimeo.com (Plus account only)
- For more on Vimeo's security settings see their [Privacy Settings Overview](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224817847-Privacy-settings-overview
)

*Cons*

- Free Vimeo account only allows 500MB/week of storage and 25GB/year. However, the Plus plan is very affordable at $60/year and allows 5GB/week and 250GB/year.

## Google Drive

[Google Drive](http://drive.google.com)

Some power Google users may find Google Drive a convenient way to share videos. The benefit of using Google drive vs. youtube is that you can stay within the Google Drive environment and there is less chance of someone stumbling across your videos.

*Pros*

- Easy to use
- Fast uploading times
- Ability to add videos to a folder and share
- Works great on and device
- Allows videos to be downloaded

*Security*

- Security settings for video on Google Drive are similar to those on a Google Doc.
  - **Specific people** - Allow specific people with Google account to view your video
  - **Anyone with a link** - Anyone with a link can view your video, but it is not searchable Additionally, you can allow anyone with a link to:
    - *View only*
    - *Comment*
    - *Edit* (applies only to video information, since Google Drive doesn't have any online editing tools.)
  - **Public** - Anyone can search on Google and view your video

  - *Disable downloading* - for each of the above security settings, you can disable downloading of your video

*Cons*

- Slower encoding time
- Less intuitive sharing features than other platforms
- Free Google Drive account is limited to 15GB. You can upgrade to 100GB for $1.99/month.

Pro tip: share a Google folder to your class that has all the videos in it. Here is an example: [goo.gl/WoY6uG](goo.gl/WoY6uG)
