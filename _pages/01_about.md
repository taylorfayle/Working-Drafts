Thanks for visiting. Here's a little about me.

Currently I'm an instructional designer at the University of Houston, where I work at the intersection of education and technology, soul and machine, embodiment and transcendence. I'm neither an advocate for digitally mediated instruction nor do I think it spells the end of education as we know it.

I also teach humanities courses and, in my spare time, I'm writing a dissertation on Hegel's Philosophy of Religion as a precursor to modern social theorists (Weber, Habermas, and Bellah) who understand the internal dynamics of religious thinking as constitutive for human rationalization.

This is an exploratory space where I write about instructional design, pedagogy, religion, art and philosophy, among other things. Some of these essays get published on the UH instructional design blog: **[instruction.uh.edu](http://instruction.uh.edu)**
